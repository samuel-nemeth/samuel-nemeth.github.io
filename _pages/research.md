This study adds to the literature on the relationship between social relationships and cognitive function by using social integration theory to examine whether a sense of community belonging at different ages is related to cognitive function in later life. We also examine whether the relationship between community belonging, and cognitive function is distinct among White, Black, and Hispanic older adults. Using data from the Health and Retirement Study including the 2017 Life History Mail Survey (N = 3,302), we use parallel measures of community belonging across 3 periods in the life course. We estimated relationships using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and lagged dependent variable models. Respondents who experienced greater community belonging at age 10 and during later life (i.e., age in 2016) had higher levels of cognitive function in 2018 than those who reported feeling less belonging with their community at those ages (b = 0.193, p < .001; b = 0.090, p < .05, respectively). The main effects of community belonging at any age were not related to change in cognitive function from 2016 to 2018; however, there were significant interaction effects between community belonging at age 10 on cognitive function in 2018 and from 2016 to 2018 (p < .05 and p < .01, respectively) with the beneficial effects of community belonging at age 10 being stronger for Black older adults compared with White older adults. These findings highlight the importance of early and later life community belonging for the cognitive functioning of older adults, and particularly for Black older adults’ cognitive function.

  <summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
Medical aid in dying (MAID) is legal in jurisdictions covering more than one-fifth of the US population and has been used by a largely White, educated population. The extent to which knowledge of MAID and preferences for personal use align with patterns of use is unknown. This cross-sectional, self-report online survey study used a national Prime Panels–based sample of US adults recruited between July 16 and August 10, 2024. A total of 3227 respondents aged 18 years or older from all US states and Washington, DC, were included. Individuals from states with legal MAID, aged 60 years or older, and members of racial and ethnic minority groups were oversampled. We evaluated knowledge of the legality of MAID in the US and in respondents’ state of residence as well as potential interest in future use of MAID. Descriptive statistics and χ2 tests were used to examine associations by demographic characteristics and place of residence. Of 3227 respondents (mean [SD] age, 55.7 [17.4] years; 1839 women [57.0%]), 1654 (51.3%) did not know if MAID was legal the US, and 1638 (50.8%) did not know if MAID was legal in their state. Respondents in states where MAID is legal were more likely to know that MAID is legal in the US compared with those in states where MAID is not legal (728 of 2164 [33.6%] vs 216 of 1063 [20.3%]; P < .001). Across all respondents, 1420 (44.0%), including 96 of 222 Asian respondents (43.2%), 206 of 605 Black respondents (34.0%), and 129 of 308 Hispanic respondents (41.9%), reported they would definitely or probably consider MAID if they received a diagnosis of a terminal illness. In this online survey study of US adults, substantial interest in using MAID as well as significant knowledge gaps regarding the legality of MAID were reported. These findings highlight the need for public education, policy initiatives, and patient-clinician discussions to ensure equitable access to patient-centered end-of-life options and informed decision-making.
