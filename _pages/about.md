My name is Samuel (Sam) Nemeth. I am interested in the interplay between genetics and the environment, aging, and health. I am a first year student in the [PhD in Sociology and Gerontology](https://www.cla.purdue.edu/academic/sociology/index.html) program at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu). I am a [Dean's Graduate Fellowship](https://www.cla.purdue.edu/research/grant-support/grad-student-research-support/deansfellowship.html) recipient and a [Presidental Excellence PhD Award](https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/purduetoday/2025/Q1/purdue-continues-to-enhance-investment-and-support-for-doctoral-students/) recipient both of which fund my PhD studies.

I am currently affiliated with the [Dunn Lab](https://www.thedunnlab.com) as well as the [Center for Aging and the Life Course](https://www.purdue.edu/aging/).

Before beginning the PhD, I recieved a Masters Degree in Public Health with a concentration in population aging, with Delta Omega Honorary Society, from the [Rutgers School of Public Health](https://sph.rutgers.edu) as a [Jennifer Elliott Population Aging Scholar](https://sph.rutgers.edu/academics/degree-programs/master-public-health-mph-degrees/online-master-public-health-population-aging#chapter=pjennifer-elliot-population-aging-scholarship-p-4047). I recieved a BA in Sociology, and a minor in Biological Sciences, _with distinction_ from [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu).
