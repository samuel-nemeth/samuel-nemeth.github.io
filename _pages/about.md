My name is Samuel Nemeth. I study health and aging as a Ph.D. student in the [Sociology department](https://www.cla.purdue.edu/academic/sociology/index.html) at Purdue University. I am a Dean's Graduate Fellowship recipient and a Presidental Excellence Ph.D. Award recipient both of which fund my Ph.D. studies.

I am also affiliated with the [Center for Aging and the Life Course](https://www.purdue.edu/aging/).

Before beginning the Ph.D., I recieved a Masters Degree in Public Health with a concentration in population aging from the Rutgers School of Public Health as a Jennifer Elliott Population Aging Scholar. I recieved a B.A. in Sociology and a minor in Biological Sciences, with distinction from Purdue University.
