My name is Samuel Nemeth. I study health and aging as a Ph.D. student in the Sociology department at Purdue University. I am a Dean's Graduate Fellowship recipient and a Presidental Excellence Ph.D. Award recipient both of which fund my Ph.D. studies.

Before beginning the Ph.D., I recieved a Masters Degree in Public Health from the Rutgers School of Public Health as a Jennifer Elliott Population Aging Scholar. I recieved a B.A. in Sociology, with distinction from Purdue University.
